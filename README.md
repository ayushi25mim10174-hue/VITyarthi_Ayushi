# Simple Financial Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python application for performing basic financial calculations. This tool helps users calculate simple interest, compound interest, loan EMIs, savings goals, and currency conversions. It's interactive, menu-driven, and includes useful financial tips.

## Features

- **Simple Interest Calculator**  
  Calculate simple interest using the formula:  
  $$\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$$  
  where *P* is principal, *R* is annual interest rate (%), and *T* is time (years).[1]

- **Compound Interest Calculator**  
  Computes compound interest considering principal, rate, time, and number of compounding periods per year.

- **Loan EMI Calculator**  
  Calculates Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) for loans using standard EMI formulas.

- **Savings Goal Calculator**  
  Helps you determine the amount to save each month to reach a target goal, factoring in expected returns.

- **Currency Converter**  
  Converts between preset currencies using fixed rates for demonstration purposes.

- **Financial Tips**  
  Provides basic financial advice at exit for healthy money management.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Choose an option from the main menu (1-6).
3. Enter required values when prompted (e.g., principal, rate, time).
4. Results will display immediately.
5. After each calculation, you can choose to perform another or exit.
6. Upon exiting, a summary of financial tips will be displayed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No extra libraries required; uses only built-in functions.

## How It Works (Example)

- **Simple Interest Example:**  
  - Enter principal amount, rate, and time in years.
  - The program calculates interest:  
    $$ \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} $$  
  - Displays interest and total amount.[1]
- **Compound Interest Example:**  
  - Enter principal, annual rate, years, and number of compounding periods per year.
  - The program computes and shows compound interest and final value.

## Disclaimer

- Exchange rates in the currency converter are fixed and for demonstration only.
- This tool is beginner-oriented and not suitable for complex financial planning.
